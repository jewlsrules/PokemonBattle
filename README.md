# PokemonBattle
Pokemon Battle Game where a player chooses a starting pokemon and battles against opponent pokemon to earn coins which can be used to purchase items.

## Getting Started
To get started open up https://jewlsrules.github.io/PokemonBattle/. This will launch a new game every time it is refreshed.

Choose your starting Pokemon. The information on the starting Pokemon is taken directly from the Pokemon API.

Follow the prompts to go to your first battle.

## Pokemon Battle
At each battle, you'll be asked to choose which attack you want to use against the opponent. Some attacks are more powerful than others, so choose wisely. Your opponent's attack will be based on the likelihood of that attack happening, and is somewhat random. 

Each opponent has a reward amount attached to it. If you beat that opponent, you win the reward amount. You can use coins to purchase items or heal your pokemon. 

If your Pokemon faints (HP: 0), then you lose the game. 

## Poke-Center
You can visit the Poke-center to heal your Pokemon back to it's max HP for a small fee. 

## PokeMart
The Pokemart contains some items that you can use your coins to purchse.  The information about these items is taken directly from the Pokemon API.

NOTE: currently the items have no in-battle functionality! 

## API
This game uses the Pokemon API at https://pokeapi.co

## Technologies Used
This app is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript & JQuery

## Approach
I built this app as a fully functional game that could be played on mobile or desktop. 

## Issues
The logic and set up was much more challenging than I originally anticipated and key features have taken longer to build than I thought they would.
