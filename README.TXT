## Pokemon Battle Game where a player chooses a starting pokemon and battles against opponent pokemon to earn coins which can be used to purchase items.

## Getting Started
To get started open up https://jewlsrules.github.io/PokemonBattle/. This will launch a new game every time it is refreshed.

Choose your starting Pokemon. The information on the starting Pokemon is taken directly from the Pokemon API

## Pokemon Battle
Choose your Pokemon's attack based on their actual attacks from the game! Be careful, if your Pokemon's HP gets to 0, you lose!

## API
 This game uses the Pokemon API at https://pokeapi.co

## Technologies Used
This app is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript & JQuery

## Approach
I built this app as a fully functional game that could be played on mobile or desktop.

## Issues
The logic and set up was much more challenging than I originally anticipated and key features have taken longer to build than I thought they would.
