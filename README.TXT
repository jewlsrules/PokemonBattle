## Technologies Used
This app is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript & JQuery

## Approach
I built this app as a fully functional game that could be played on mobile or desktop.

## Issues
The logic and set up was much more challenging than I originally anticipated and key features have taken longer to build than I thought they would.
